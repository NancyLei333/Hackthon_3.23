### Better Colgate On-Demand

Colgate is in the middle of nowhere so it is really hard to get around with limited
 transportation. The on demand shuttle service is provided to go to airport and 
 train stations, but it is really hard to track the availability of shuttles,
 number of passengers and estimated price. It is also very hard to change any 
 information or communicate because they don't have a platform and mainly rely on 
 email and phone calls. 

 We want to create a web app that helps with the transparency of this and make it
 easier to navigate the trip details and make reservations.

 Ideally this will be utilized by Colgate on-demand scheduling to ensure more 
 accessible and convenient shuttle services and better 
 user experience. 

# How the Application Works
Colgate On-Demand allows users to view available shuttle services, join 
existing trips, and book new reservations. Upon accessing the application, 
users can:

Browse the "Shuttle Schedule" to find upcoming trips.
Click "Join" on a desired trip, leading to a pre-filled booking form with trip details.
Use the "Book Now" feature to create new reservations with custom itineraries.
Manage their bookings through the "Account" section, where past trips and user details are displayed.

# Difficulty: 
The main challenge we experienced is that with the limitation of time, we are not 
able to integrate real-time scheduling data with the application.
