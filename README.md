# Better Colgate On-Demand

Colgate is in the middle of nowhere so it is really hard to get around with limited
 transportation. The on demand shuttle service is provided to go to airports and 
 train stations, but it is really hard to track the availability of shuttles,
 number of passengers and estimated price. It is also very hard to change any 
 information or communicate because they don't have a platform and mainly rely on 
 email and phone calls. 

 We want to create a web app that helps with the transparency of this and make it
 easier to navigate the trip details and make reservations.

 Ideally this will be utilized by Colgate on-demand scheduling to ensure more 
 accessible and convenient shuttle services and better 
 user experience. 

### Purpose & Motivation
Our motivation for developing Colgate On-Demand is the need to improve accessibility and manageability of transportation services at Colgate. We aimed to create a user-friendly platform that would streamline the booking process, offer real-time updates on shuttle schedules, and accommodate the dynamic transportation needs of our community.

### Development of the Application
The application was developed using HTML, CSS, and Figma, emphasizing the interactive experiences. We are mainly at the frontend system for managing reservations, user accounts, and trip schedules. Development phases included planning, designing the user interface, implementing front-end interactivity. 

### How the Application Works
Colgate On-Demand allows users to view available shuttle services, join 
existing trips, and book new reservations. Upon accessing the application, 
users can:

- Browse the "Shuttle Schedule" to find upcoming trips.
- Click "Join" on a current trip, no need to create a new reservation when a close trip exists, leading to a pre-filled booking form with trip details.
- Use the "Book Now" feature to create new reservations with custom itineraries.
- Manage their bookings through the "Account" section, where past trips and user details are displayed.

### Difficulty: 
- The main challenge we experienced is that with the limitation of time, we are not 
able to integrate real-time scheduling data with the application.
- We realized that we lack much experience at the backend to store and retrieve data, so we put our focus more on illustrating the interactive user experiences in the "Prototype" track.

### Go-to-Market Strategy
Colgate On-Demand will be launched through the university's web portal, making it readily accessible to the campus community. Marketing strategies include email campaigns, informational booths, and collaboration with student organizations. The application is designed to be scalable, with the potential to expand services based on user demand and feedback, ensuring it remains a vital resource for campus transportation.
